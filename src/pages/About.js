      <h2>Capstone Description</h2>
      <p>
        The unrequired widgets in this project represent areas I wanted to
        explore. I made the dictionary and joke widgets because I wanted to
        practice using fetch and working with different APIs and documentation.
        The Dropzone widget was a process that I knew nothing about before I
        started. I didn't get as far as I wanted to (I would still like to add
        the functionality to open files and delete them), but I learned a lot in
        the process of building the page, even with it's limited functionality.{" "}

      <h2>What I've Learned From the Frontend Course</h2>
      <p>
        This course was hard for multiple reasons, but mostly due to a learning
        disability that makes it extremely difficult for me to learn aurally,
        especially in unstructured environments. Because of this, I had to rely
        on online documentation and trial and error almost exclusively while
        learning front end concepts. <br />
        <br />I was able to use posted assignments to guide my personal study,
        along with individual assignment feedback (which was very helpful).
        Although this was overwhelming at times, I appreciate the opportunity I
        had to learn how to sift through online resources and troubleshoot
        problems in my code independently. <br />
        <br />
        I've really appreciated the opportunity to take this course, and I look
        forward to exploring front end development even more.
